# CopsAndRobbers

S. Saha, Goutam Paul. **Cops and Robbers with Multiplicity**. Analyze the "cops and robber" game with the modification to the game rule that even cops are venerable, multiple robbers are present and multiple cops can sit in a single grid. The objective was to find the multiplicity of the cops required to catch all the robbers, where multiplicity is the number of cops that can be placed in a single grid.
